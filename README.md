<h1>Checkpoint Talk: Operating Systems and Development Environments</h1>

<h2>With Oliver Lavers</h2>

Hi folks, I'm Oliver! Welcome to my She Codes Checkpoint Talk. This Github repo contains all the high-points from my talk, as well as any diagrams or code demos I used over the course of the evening.

In this talk I'll be discussing the following topics:

- [Operating Systems - What Do Developers Need To Know?](#operating-systems---what-do-developers-need-to-know)
  - [How Computers Work](#how-computers-work)
  - [The Kernel](#the-kernel)
  - [The Shell](#the-shell)
  - [The Terminal](#the-terminal)
- [Development Environments - Why Bother?](#development-environments---why-bother)
- [Important Factors in Dev. Environment Choice](#important-factors-in-dev-environment-choice)
- [Getting The Most Out Of Your Starter Setup](#getting-the-most-out-of-your-starter-setup)
- [Paths To Becoming A Dev. Environment Blackbelt](#paths-to-becoming-a-dev-environment-blackbelt)

This might seem like a lot of info to get through about if you're just getting into coding, but trust me - this is what I wish I had known before I ever set finger to keyboard. 

A little bit of background here can give you the context you need to launch yourself into the most intimidating parts of coding with gusto. The path to being a blackbelt hacker doesn't have an end, but this is a good way to begin!
