This might seem like a lot of info to get through about if you're just getting into coding, but trust me - this is what I wish I had known before I ever set finger to keyboard. 

A little bit of background here can give you the context you need to launch yourself into the most intimidating parts of coding with gusto. The path to being a blackbelt hacker doesn't have an end, but this is a good way to begin!

## Operating Systems - What Do Developers Need To Know?
### How Computers Work
> Yep, we are getting down to the really tricky bits right away.

There's an extent to which the theory of computer science actually gets in the way of understanding how this stuff works. The field has turned into a very abstract branch of engineering, which means that the hidden secrets of IT are quite divorced from the point at which the rubber meets the road.

For instance, we often hear that computers run on binary code - `1`'s and `0`s. This is 100% true, and also **100% useless** when it comes to the practical work that a beginner can engage with.

Here's a better explanation:

Seriously. Just imagine for a moment that there are elves inside each component of the computer, and they do what they're told to on command.

Let's take a look at some of those components:

#### The Hard Drive
![](./img/hard_drive.jpg)
This element is used for long term storage of information. It's the computer equivalent of long term memory. Files live here, and are made up of text or binary data.

#### RAM
![](./img/ram.jpg)
(AKA - **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory)

This element is used for short-term storage of information. The computer equivalent of short-term or working memory. This is where the variables we use in our code are stored while our programs are running.

#### The CPU
![](./img/cpu.jpg)

(AKA - **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit)

This element is the computer equivalent of a frontal lobe. It is the physical part of the hardware that can manipulate information. 

It doesn't independently know *how* it should manipulate information, though. On its own it would just sit there like a big chunk of inanimate silicon. 

To do anything useful it needs some secret sauce...

### The Operating System
![](./img/os.png)

This element is software, not hardware. It's a the most fundamental program that your computer knows how to run.

The operating system is stored on the hard drive. Every time the computer is turned on, it immediately gets loaded into the CPU, and starts telling it how to be a computer. 

The operating system tells the CPU how to find your files, what to display on the screen, how to understand the other programs, and how to respond to your requests. 

This means that everything else that happens on your computer has your operating system as its foundation. Any program that runs on your machine needs to be crafted to fit your particular operating system, and the ways that you can interact with the computer will be governed by the operating system's specifications.
